# Stock Exchange Analysis Report
## Introduction
This report presents an analysis of stock exchange data aimed at predicting peak and trough stock prices and minimizing trader spending. The dataset provided contains essential features related to stock prices, which were analyzed using descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics techniques.

## Data Analysis Activities and Tools
I utilized Python programming language and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis. The dataset was explored using descriptive analytics techniques, and predictive models were developed to forecast peak and trough stock prices. Prescriptive analytics techniques were employed to determine optimal stock quantities for minimizing trader spending.

## Descriptive Analytics
I analyzed key features such as stock price, volume, and trend using appropriate measures and visualization charts. A contingency table was created to identify associations between different features, providing valuable insights into the dataset. Descriptive analytics techniques contribute to decision-making by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

## Predictive Analytics
Feature selection techniques were applied to identify the best features for predicting peak and trough stock prices. Different predictive models, including regression and classification algorithms, were employed to forecast high and low labels. Evaluation measures such as accuracy, precision, and recall were used to compare the performance of different techniques. Visualizations were used to showcase the quality of predictive models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

## Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics techniques were utilized to determine the optimal stock quantities for minimizing trader spending. Using a linear programming approach, we formulated an objective function considering stock prices and quantity constraints for each bank. The results were compared with different techniques to identify the most cost-effective solution.

## Conclusion
Data analytical techniques play a crucial role in decision-making processes in the stock exchange domain. Descriptive analytics provides insights into historical data, predictive analytics forecasts future trends, and prescriptive analytics recommends the best course of action. By leveraging these techniques, traders can make informed decisions to optimize their investments and minimize spending.
